# Changelog

## 7.9.2: dribble smoothing and realism
- **Steady tempo.** The ball has its own dribble clock instead of riding the run cycle: about 2.2
  bounces/s standing, 2.7 jogging and 3.4 sprinting (was 2.4 / 5.3 / 7.9). The tempo eases between
  speeds, so it never jumps when you start or stop sprinting.
- **Gravity-shaped bounce.** Quick off the floor, a hang at the top, a short contact. Sprinting changes
  the bounce's shape, not its tempo: the ball goes out ahead on a lower, longer bounce. Standing keeps it
  high and close.
- **Hand and sound.** The hand pump follows the ball; the bounce sound plays on the real floor contact.
- **No pops.** Crossovers, behind-the-backs and pump fakes no longer make the ball jump. A picked-up
  dribble is held instead of still bouncing. The dribble follows tall/short and solid/lean bodies.
- **Gameplay unchanged.** Steals and fumbles read the old hand-based ball position; steal odds and
  CPU-vs-CPU stats measured the same. Details: [halkotob/IslamDunk#1](https://github.com/halkotob/IslamDunk/pull/1).
- New `dribble` test; the `controls` test no longer flakes on a random steal.

## 7.9.1: new logo
- The mark is redrawn from scratch as one simple silhouette (no internal lines): a brother in a kufi
  and a full-length thawb taking off for a dunk. He leans in, the ball arm is fully extended, the free
  arm is out for balance, the front knee drives up, and the thawb streams back off the trailing leg.
  Picked from four rounds of options.
- Stored as a baked alpha mask (`DUNKER_PNG` in `src/render/logo.js`), tinted gold on the title and
  splash, and gold on the green tile for the app icons (regenerated with `scripts/make-icons.mjs`).

## 7.9: feel and fairness, new logo, intro staging
- **New logo.** A dunker in a thawb and kufi, in the split-leg, ball-overhead dunk pose, as one gold
  silhouette. It's on the title screen and splash, and in the app icons (regenerated from the game's own
  drawing code by `scripts/make-icons.mjs`).
- **Sprint.**
  - Everyone jogs 8% faster, and sprinting is a bigger step up (1.5x the jog, was 1.42x).
  - Keyboard: hold **Left Shift** while moving (Right Shift for player 2). Double-tap sprint is gone.
  - Touch: pushing the stick to its ring is full speed. Sprinting needs a deliberate push past the dashed
    outer ring, and the knob glows while you sprint. Quick flicks no longer sprint.
- **Stamina, same rule for you and the CPU.**
  - Turbo used to refill only with sprint released, so holding it pinned you at zero. Meanwhile the CPU,
    which lets go, sprinted about twice as often.
  - Now anyone who runs the bar dry is winded until it's back to 45%. The bar refills even while you
    hold sprint and shows red while winded.
  - Measured result: holding sprint now gives you about 35% sprint time; the CPU gets about 21%.
- **Walls.** Players stop at the baselines instead of walking into the gym end walls. A loose ball
  bounces off the end walls and the near sideline back toward the court (it used to travel 70 units past
  the baseline, behind the walls and off frame). The bottom player card turns see-through while someone
  is behind it.
- **Fair restarts.** On side-outs, check balls, 1-on-1 and half-court inbounds, no defender starts
  within arm's length of the handler. Anyone crowding him steps back between his man and the basket, and
  a teammate on top of the handler spreads out. Before this, the defender who fouled you could still be
  touching you.
- **Career intro.**
  - The brothers are busy when you walk in: Khalil shoots around (and swishes), Nasser stretches, Uncle
    Mahmoud sits on a folding chair, Tariq keeps the stat sheet on a clipboard, and Uncle Siddiq pours
    chai at a little table.
  - Whoever you walk up to stops, turns to you and talks with his hands; you nod along. Cinematic bars
    slide in during conversations.
  - Sh. Saleem walks in with you, then goes to his spot. Names only show for people near you.
- **Mobile intro fixes.** The touch stick now works on the walk outside the masjid; before, you
  couldn't move. TALK advances dialogue; before, only a tap on the right spot of the canvas did, which
  read as a freeze.
- **Tests.** New `feel` test (stamina parity, walls, side-out spacing). The `controls` test no longer
  flakes when a turnover inbound is still in the air. Seeded CPU games differ from v7.6 on purpose
  (speed and stamina changed).

## 7.8: career start, body builds, team tiers, in-world intro
- **In-world intro** (`src/career/intro-world.js`). New careers no longer open on a text cutscene. You walk
  up to Sh. Saleem outside Masjid Al-Amanah, follow him up the path and into the gym, then walk around and
  meet Khalil, Nasser, Uncle Mahmoud, Tariq and Uncle Siddiq where they're standing (a checklist tracks who
  you've met). You can shoot around while you're at it. Dialogue is shorter, it appears in speech bubbles
  over the speaker, and "Skip intro" (or Esc) is always available.
- **Creator** (`src/career/builds.js`). A big gold **Start career** button sits under the preview
  (Tab jumps to it). A live **Starting stats** panel shows what your build is good and bad at.
- **Body builds.** Height, build and play style each trade stats:
  - Short: quicker, better hands. Tall: dunks and defends better.
  - Lean: faster with more stamina. Solid: stronger at the rim and on defense.
  - Each play style leans into its strengths.

  Every combination sums to exactly zero, and no stat moves more than ±3. The changes sit on top of
  trained levels, so existing saves rebalance automatically, and changing your look later moves them
  back. The hub and Train screens show the bonus next to each stat.
- **CPU teams.**
  - **Bodies:** career rosters get heights and builds that suit their archetype (rim runners and stoppers
    run big, shooters and playmakers small). They render at that size and their stats include the same
    trades.
  - **Tiers:** each stage now has two weaker, three even and two stronger teams, with the rival included
    and labels based on actual roster strength. Stronger teams also play slightly smarter.
  - **Display:** the hub shows the next opponent's rating (Beatable / Even / Contender). Pregame shows the
    rating and each player's body.
- Quick play, online and seeded CPU games are unchanged (identical to v7.6). The `career-intro` test covers
  the new flow, the zero-sum builds and the tiers.

## 7.7: adaptive resolution
Benchmarks on real devices (`?bench=1`) showed the drawing code using 2–5 ms per frame, with the only
dips in the busiest venue (Grand Ummah Dome, 2400×1350 on a Retina Mac: 53 fps average, occasional
66 ms frames). So instead of a renderer rewrite (the PixiJS proposal is shelved), v7.7 adds adaptive
resolution (`src/render/adaptive-res.js`):
- During play, if more than 12% of the last ~2 s of frames run late, the canvas draws at a lower pixel
  ratio (100% → 88% → 76% → 66% of normal, never below 1×). After 6 s with under 2% late frames it steps
  back up. A step up that brings drops back is undone and that level skipped for 30 s, so it never flickers.
- Late is measured against the fastest cadence the device has shown, capped at 60 Hz: a phone locked
  to 30 fps (iOS Low Power Mode) isn't mistaken for a slow one, and 120 Hz screens aren't chased.
- Options › Resolution: Auto (default, shows the current level) or Full.
- Only the canvas backing size changes; layout, input and gameplay are untouched (seeded CPU games
  identical to v7.6).
- The benchmark now reports the resolution level per scenario; `tests/run.mjs` has an `adaptive-res` test.

## Project restructure for Steam readiness (shipped with 7.6)

No gameplay, visual or balance changes.

- **Source layout.** The 13,549-line `index.html` is split along its existing section markers into 58 files
  under `src/` (`core`, `sim`, `render`, `screens`, `career`, `online`, `data`), joined in
  `src/manifest.json` order into the same single script. The page shell is `web/index.html`.
  Old-line → new-file map: [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md).
- **Build tooling (Vite).** `npm run dev` (live reload, source-mapped to `src/`), `npm run build:web`
  (single-file web build), `npm run publish:web` (updates the GitHub Pages files at the repo root),
  `npm run build:electron` / `dist:electron` (desktop app).
- **Desktop app (Electron).** Main process with window/menu/fullscreen and window-size presets, a sandboxed
  preload, file-based saves in the user data folder (atomic writes + backup, `localStorage` mirrored),
  icon and app metadata. Steamworks is not wired yet.
- **Tests.** `npm test`: seeded CPU-vs-CPU parity against a reference build, scripted controls, half court,
  career flow, online over all three transports (claude.ai room and Firebase via local fakes, loopback with
  the P2P link and its fallback), and iPhone layouts. `npm run test:electron`: desktop playthrough, save
  file, relaunch, fullscreen, online between two windows.
- **Dead code removed** (verified unreferenced): `DRILL_KEYS`, `FAR_W`/`FAR_PX`, `skyGrad()`,
  `ALL_BACKDROPS`. 8 lines.
- `icons/` and `manifest.webmanifest` moved to `assets/`. The copies at the repo root are now build output.

## 7.6
Online game settings (points to win, half court), peer-to-peer online link, pump fake → double dribble,
visuals pass (Lilita One font, bevelled UI, logo, rim light, impact effects).

## 7.5
Mobile and browser fit (safe areas, no double-tap zoom, scaled touch controls, Add to Home Screen).

## 7.4
Online lobby, lower lag (fixed send rate, guest prediction, lag compensation), ball magnet.

## 7.3
Online 1 on 1 (no CPU).
