# Changelog

## Unreleased: project restructure for Steam readiness (game version stays 7.6)

No gameplay, visual or balance changes.

- **Source layout.** The 13,549-line `index.html` is split along its existing section markers into 58 files
  under `src/` (`core`, `sim`, `render`, `screens`, `career`, `online`, `data`), joined in
  `src/manifest.json` order into the same single script. The page shell is `web/index.html`.
  Old-line → new-file map: [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md).
- **Build tooling (Vite).** `npm run dev` (live reload, source-mapped to `src/`), `npm run build:web`
  (single-file web build), `npm run publish:web` (updates the GitHub Pages files at the repo root),
  `npm run build:electron` / `dist:electron` (desktop app).
- **Desktop app (Electron).** Main process with window/menu/fullscreen and window-size presets, a sandboxed
  preload, file-based saves in the user data folder (atomic writes + backup, `localStorage` mirrored),
  icon and app metadata. Steamworks is not wired yet.
- **Tests.** `npm test`: seeded CPU-vs-CPU parity against a reference build, scripted controls, half court,
  career flow, online over all three transports (claude.ai room and Firebase via local fakes, loopback with
  the P2P link and its fallback), and iPhone layouts. `npm run test:electron`: desktop playthrough, save
  file, relaunch, fullscreen, online between two windows.
- **Dead code removed** (verified unreferenced): `DRILL_KEYS`, `FAR_W`/`FAR_PX`, `skyGrad()`,
  `ALL_BACKDROPS`. 8 lines.
- `icons/` and `manifest.webmanifest` moved to `assets/`. The copies at the repo root are now build output.

## 7.6
Online game settings (points to win, half court), peer-to-peer online link, pump fake → double dribble,
visuals pass (Lilita One font, bevelled UI, logo, rim light, impact effects).

## 7.5
Mobile and browser fit (safe areas, no double-tap zoom, scaled touch controls, Add to Home Screen).

## 7.4
Online lobby, lower lag (fixed send rate, guest prediction, lag compensation), ball magnet.

## 7.3
Online 1 on 1 (no CPU).
